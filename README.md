# Tittle of the project: Secure Messaging System

## Short Description about the project

The Secure Messaging System is a cryptography-based project designed to provide a safe and reliable way to send messages over the internet.  
It demonstrates how modern cryptographic techniques can work together to protect digital communication:  
- **AES** encrypts messages than sent from the sender to receiver, so only the intended receiver can read them.  
- **RSA** encrypts the AES key and ecurely transmits the encryption key to the receiver.  
- **HMAC** checks the message for any changes during sending and ensures that messages have not been tampered with during transmission.
